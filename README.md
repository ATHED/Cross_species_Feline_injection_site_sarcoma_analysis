**Abstract**

**Background:** 
Feline injection-site sarcoma (FISS), an aggressive iatrogenic subcutaneous malignancy, is challenging
to manage clinically and little is known about the molecular basis of its pathogenesis. Tumor transcriptome
profiling has proved valuable for gaining insights into the molecular basis of cancers and for identifying new
therapeutic targets. Here, we report the first study of the FISS transcriptome and the first cross-species comparison
of the FISS transcriptome with those of anatomically similar soft-tissue sarcomas in dogs and humans.
Methods: Using high-throughput short-read paired-end sequencing, we comparatively profiled FISS tumors vs.
normal tissue samples as well as cultured FISS-derived cell lines vs. skin-derived fibroblasts. We analyzed the mRNA-
seq data to compare cancer/normal gene expression level, identify biological processes and molecular pathways
that are associated with the pathogenesis of FISS, and identify multimegabase genomic regions of potential
somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) in FISS. We additionally conducted cross-species analyses to compare the
transcriptome of FISS to those of soft-tissue sarcomas in dogs and humans, at the level of cancer/normal gene
expression ratios.

**Results:** 
We found: 
- (1) substantial differential expression biases in feline orthologs of human oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes suggesting conserved functions in FISS; 
- (2) a genomic region with recurrent SCNA in human
sarcomas that is syntenic to a feline genomic region of probable SCNA in FISS;
- (3) significant overlap of the
pattern of transcriptional alterations in FISS with the patterns of transcriptional alterations in soft-tissue sarcomas in
humans and in dogs. We demonstrated that a protein, BarH-like homeobox 1 (BARX1), has increased expression in
FISS cells at the protein level. We identified 11 drugs and four target proteins as potential new therapies for FISS,
and validated that one of them (GSK-1059615) inhibits growth of FISS-derived cells in vitro.

**Conclusions:** 
(1) Window-based analysis of mRNA-seq data can uncover SCNAs. (2) The transcriptome of FISS-
derived cells is highly consistent with that of FISS tumors. (3) FISS is highly similar to soft-tissue sarcomas in dogs
and humans, at the level of gene expression. This work underscores the potential utility of comparative oncology in
improving understanding and treatment of FISS.
